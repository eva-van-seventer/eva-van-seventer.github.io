    Culture:
  </h2>

 

<p class="main-text">  My culture has been influenced mostly through the people surrounding me, such as my family, friends and teachers. My parents have taught me why kind and serving to others is so important. My 5 sisters have influenced me to be creative such as in art, op shopping or sewing, and they have also taught me a lot of patience!
  Ive learnt perseverance, respect and persistent effort at the martial art I attend. My friends have helped me understand how important it is to support each other and to be there especially through difficult times.

<h2 class="subtitle">
 Identity:
</h2>


<p class="main-text">My identity has been formed by my own values and influenced by these people which im trying to improve day to day. Some of my core values include respecting every individual and their unique personality, background and set of skills. I read a quote from Albert Einstein which goes like 'everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.'
  I try to persevere throughout difficult circumstances, I think that your effort is the most important value in a lot of cases.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Strengths + Limitations:</h2>
<p class="main-text">My strengths would include perseverance as mentioned earlier my martial art has helped me develop this strength and has made keen for a challenge, which will hopefully help me to get pass some learning obstacles. I also think listening to other people is a strength as I enjoy learning about different opinions, values and ideas from a different perspective. I think this skill would be assisting in my career development as it would mean that I can incorporate and work together with other people 
  and their ideas into the project. Another strength I have would be integrity, I can keep accountable for my own work and mistakes I may make.
  
  
  I think my limitations may be a lack of organization skills in some particular areas such as communication or time management, I plan (ironically) to make a greater effort in managing these skills in future. I also have some social anxiety in some situations which may impact my learning. I think I will also need to focus on one thing at a time, as my multitasking skills aren't very strong.  
  </p><h2 class="subtitle">
 Group Example:</h2>
<p class="main-text">I was in a group of seven people for a Home Economics assignment which went smoothly until, the second lock-down. The change was so abrupt which impacted our plan. We  also hadn't discussed beforehand the importance of communicating and finishing this internal assignment which caused poor communication.
  We tried to find the most effective communication technique such as zoom meetings and a social media platform. This worked moderately well, but some students didn't show up or respond to the group chat. This caused some tension within the group as so members felt they were doing their own as well as other members work and that the work was not evenly distributed. We tried to emphasis the importance of finishing the group project, which was relatively effective.
  Some other strategies I would try now is to assign a group leader who would then assign the group members their individual tasks. This would minimize the time needed to discuss the assigned tasks and would also create a more fair and even distribution of the tasks. It may also engage more group members and ensure more people attend the zooms as they would be shorter most-likely.

 Ethical Decision:</h2>

 <p class="main-text">During my last year of secondary school, there was lots of division between friend groups. I attended a small school, so everyone knew about the drama and had their own perspective to who's right and who's wrong. It only escalated from there with more unnecessary drama, with complete division of the majority of the class. I had close friends on both sides so heard both perspectives of the story and didn't know whether to chose a side or stay neutral and try to reemerge the groups. In the end I tried to create communication between the groups, which helped to some degree as it helped them them understand each other more, as I thought the reasons for the beginning of the drama weren't really valid at all and most of it was misunderstanding.
