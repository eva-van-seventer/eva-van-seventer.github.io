        <h2 class= "subtitle"> 3 Things I Learnt about Myself:
         </h2>
      
         <li class="main-text">
          I've learnt that I need to ask for help when I need it and to see it as a growing opportunity.
        </li>
        <li class="main-text">
          That I need to step out of the fixed mindset and to see struggles as a way for growth. 
            </li>
         <li class="main-text">
          I've also noticed that I work a lot more effectively in a stable emotional state, which reminds me of why EQ is so important.

           </li>
    

        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          Roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in programming?
        </h2>
         <p class="main-text">To work and learn effectively you to recognize where you're at emotionally to see if you if you're in a good mental state which is ready to learn and focus. You need a good balance of care for yourself and the people around you, so that you and the people around you to work productively.

        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h2>      
      
        <p class="main-text">
          How much there was which I never heard of or learnt at all previously, which may have been helpful to learn at various places (school for example). It also surprised me about how helpful it is to learn about these concepts.


         </p>
        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2> 
      
        
         <p class="main-text">
          I think that finding some personal examples for some questions was a bit difficult as you really have to focus on your experiences to find one which is applicable.

         </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Why spend so much time focusing on core learning in this course?
         </h2>

     
        <p class="main-text">
          Core learning means that you can work in a more healthy mindset which helps you work productively and also increases your likelihood of employment after the course as its what employers are looking for. It also means that when you are working with a group of people, your communication can become more clear and helpful.
         </p>
       
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Is learning core feel like a waste of time? 
        </h2>

        <p class="main-text">
          I think that most of the core I can apply and understand why we're learning it -it teaches me new knowledge and skills which I know i'll need in various areas of my future. It builds a stronger growth mindset which helps me tackle various problems, so I think it's not a waste of time.
