        <h2 class= "subtitle"> Long term goal?
         </h2>
         

         <p class="main-text">
          To work in an environment which people support one another in and upholds values similar to mine. I would like to work in a career related to programming, which helps other people. Ideally a career I can work productively in and enjoy it.


             </p>
        

        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          Strengths and Limitations?
        </h2>
         <p class="main-text">   I think my strength would be perseverance as I've used through the foundation course, and taking ownership for my own learning. I've noticed both these strengths through foundations which has helped me to learn. I think enthusiasm towards programming is also a strength I have -it makes it easier to work through problems for a while and means I'm excited to begin a new challenge. My limitations would have to be not enough communication particularly on the cohort chat. I need to work on trying to answer more of others questions and participating in giving feedback. I also think I tend to sometimes get distracted easily when I don't have a strong interest in the project which will be a limitation I need to focus on using self-discipline to improve.      </p>
     
        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          Biggest Non-technical Challenge?
        </h2>      
      
        <p class="main-text">Basically focus in general. Keeping focused on the end of the day goal, end of the week goal, end of the 9 weeks will probably be quite difficult for me personally. I tend to lose focus quite easily if I'm working on something that I don't have much interest in, which means it takes longer for me to complete the work as I tend to procrastinate it.

          </p>
        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          Non-technical Skills Developed at Dev Academy?

        </h2> 
      
        <p class="main-text">
          Probably still my organizational skills and ability to manage both my communication and time-management. I also think that my confidence in 
          pair work or group work could be improved and developed, specifically my confidence in communicating my ideas.
         </p>
        
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Expectations of Bootcamp team?

         </h2>
     <p class="main-text">I'd appreciate if they give support when needed, such as encouragement, 
      guidance if i'm stuck and understanding. I'd also appreciate honest and constructive feedback. 
             </p>
       
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Personal Expectations at Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          To put in my best effort, and take ownership of my learning. I want to focus on persevering past problems and look to the end goal. I also want to show more support for others in my cohort and participate more in the cohort discussions.




         </p>

        <h2 class= "subtitle">
          How and where will you seek help in a timely way?
         </h2> 
          
        <p class="main-text"> I plan to manage the stress of bootcamp through communication with the people around me and my facilitator. I'm going to try accept that there will be times when my best effort won't get me pass the problem and to reach out for help. I want to manage my emotional and mental health throughout this course to allow me to work productively.
