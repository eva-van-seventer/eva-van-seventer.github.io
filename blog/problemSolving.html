        Problem Example

A time I struggled at was a challenge using filtering. The first problem was when I couldn't figure out how to join an array after splitting it. I researched on Google to try and find the right method, after trialing multiple methods I eventually found the join method which now seems kind of obvious. I used it briefly but thought it wouldn't work as I forgot to add the end brackets which stopped it from working without me realising. This caused another circle of methods.  Some other problem solving techniques I also used were to look carefully and console.log each line to try and figure out what was going wrong and to understand the purpose of each line, as I thought the problem might be elsewhere(it wasn't). Eventually got back to trying out the join method again with a pleasant surprise that it actually did work! I felt like I needed a lot of patience to not get frustrated throughout this process as it didn't seem like a difficult problem but did take a while to work out in the end. I learnt about being more careful when trialing methods as it is possible to come across the right solution but not realise it.

            Pseudocode:
             </h2>
    
         <p class="main-text">  This is the process of breaking a bigger problem into smaller steps, and using comments to discuss those steps so that you have a  bit of a plan. I tried out this method in one case I found it very helpful but the other times I tried it, not as much - I think it might help to understand the best way to break up the steps.

            Trying Something:
             </h2>
      
        <p class="main-text">
            Trying something is basically just giving anything a go even if it's unlikely for it to work. I used this technique quite often which helped me to understand the purpose of other functions even if I didn't really need them in that particular problem.

        <h2 class= "main-text">
            Rubber Ducky Method:
        </h2>      
      
        <p class="main-text">
            This is when you talk yourself through the steps to try and understand what is going on at each function. You basically explain what is happening in the function from the begining to end which helps solidate your understanding. I found this technique very helpful as it essentially is like reteaching it to myself and helps me understand why I wrote what I wrote.

            Reading Error Messages:
        </h2> 
      
        <p class="main-text">
            This is when you look at your console and interpret what it says is going wrong. This helped me notice simple errors of formatting, unclosed brackets and spelling errors, which otherwise may have taken me a while to realise.




         </p>
  
        <h2 class="main-text">
     Console Log:
        </h2>

        
        <p class="main-text">
            This is when you get the console to tell you what your function will print. I also find this helpful as it gives you an inside view of what you're doing and tells you immediately when there's an error.

            Googling:
        </h2>
       
        <p class="main-text">
            Googling is searching the web for resources and answers to help you understand the concepts. THere were some times when I found this technique very helpful and other times not so much, this coyld be because of how much there is to search through, especially when your problem is difficult to explain.

                Asking Your Peers for Help:
            </h2>
           
            <p class="main-text">This is when you see if your peers can explain the particular problem more effectively. I find this quite helpful, as my peers explain it with roughly the same knowledge we just learnt

                    Asking Coaches for Help:
                    
                </h2>
               
                <p class="main-text">
                    This is when you ask your facilitator or mentor to point you in the right direction of a problem. I also found this helpful as they don't tend to give you the answer but give you a hint as to where to go next which helps you still work but from a different perspective.

                        Improving your process with reflection:

                    <p class="main-text">
                        This is when you look at how you approached a problem and think about how effective it was, and what you can change for next time. I struggle to remember to take the time to consciously focus on this technique but tend to subconsciously. From observing this, I often find myself repeating techniques which I found the most helpful and effective in previous problems.  </p>
