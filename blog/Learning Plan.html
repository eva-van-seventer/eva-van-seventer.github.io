    <h2 class="subtitle">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    To become a developer in an area in which I can express my creativity and can be the most productive in. 
    
    
    
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">
    A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
    
    My strengths would include perseverance such as within my martial art has helped me develop this strength and has made keen for a challenge. This will hopefully help me to get pass some learning obstacles. I also think listening to other people is a strength as I enjoy learning about different opinions, values and ideas from a different perspective. I think this skill would be assisting in my career development as it would mean that I can incorporate and work together with other people. 
     
    I think my limitations may be a lack of organization skills in some particular areas such as communication or time management, I plan (ironically) to make a greater effort in managing these skills in future. This is the first time I'm properly learning any programming language which may mean I might take extra time to understand some concepts. I think I will need to focus on one thing at a time, as my multitasking skills aren't very strong.  
    <h2 class="subtitle">
    What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    I would like to see stronger performance in communication and presentation, and a stronger ability to communicate clearly. I would also like to develop my organization skills and to stay on top of time management. 
    <h2 class="subtitle">
    A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
    I plan to manage my workload by breaking down a big task into smaller tasks and assigning the smaller tasks to various days throughout the week. I plan to communicate with the other learners and facilitators which will help keep on track of where things are at. When things are building up and starting to get to me, I plan to take a step back to reassess what else needs to get done and decide when is a manageable and appropriate time to get it done.
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    I will let my facilitator know if things are getting too busy. I also plan to ask family members who also have some knowledge if they're available.
    
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">
    A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
    I would appreciate honest constructive criticism, encouragement and support.
    <h2 class="subtitle">
    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
    I attend a martial art 2-3 times a week at 6pm weekdays or 1pm sundays, so wont be available at these times. I also try to avoid working on Sundays, so will try to get the majority of work done during weekdays.
