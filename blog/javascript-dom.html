        <h2 class= "subtitle"> CSS + HTML Analogy
         </h2>
         <img id="java-example"  src="images/css-vs-html.png" photo.jpe alt= " photo";>

         <p class="main-text">
         Html is like the bone structure of a person -it keeps the arms and legs in the right place and also has the size of the bones. Inside the Html head (or skeleton head) it sets all of the stuff the user wouldn't be able to see on the website page yet is necessary information about the page for the browser. This is similar to how heaps is going on inside our brains yet no one around us can see it. 
        </p>
         <p class="main-text">
        Css is like the presentation of the skeleton, our clothes are unique colours, styles and shapes. Essentailly it dresses up the html and focuses primarily on the appearance of the structure. 
        </p>

        <h2 class= "subtitle">
         Control Flow + Looping
        </h2>
         <p class="main-text">This is talking about the order which the code occurs in, it really is about the flow of it. For example when making an instant coffee you would usually first turn on the jug, then put one teaspoon of coffee in the cup and then pour the hot water and lastly the milk into the cup. These things usually tend to follow in this order yet there are exceptions.
         </p>
      
        <p class="main-text">
         The exception is looping. If you decide you're really tired you might use a spoon to put two teaspoons of coffee in, instead of one. You also might want a different source of energy as well so you use a spoon and put some sugar in. 
         The loop in this case is using a spoon to put something in your coffee, and it will continue to repeat until you've finished putting everything you want in the coffee. After this it will continue on with the control flow and you'll probably put in the hot water next. 
        </p>
        <h2 class= "subtitle">
        The DOM
        </h2>      
      
        <p class="main-text">
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is how html, css and javascript all work together. The DOM essentially translates all the programming languages and interprets them into the browser. 
        </p>
        <h2 class= "subtitle">
         Arrays vs Objects
        </h2> 
      
        <p class="main-text">
         An array can be identified by the [] which contain a list of items separated by commas. 

         </p>
         <p class="main-text">
         Items within an array can be accessed in code by first typing in which array it is and then identifying the position of the item using a number. The array is in a specific order, which starts counting from 0 (ie the first item in the array is 0th spot)

        </p>
        <h2 class="main-text">
        For Example:
         </h2>

        <img id="java-example"  src="images/array-example.png" photo.jpe alt= " photo";>
        <p class="main-text">
        An objects can be identified by the {} which contain a more detailed list of items which are labeled and usually give more information about the list. 
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
        Items within an object can be accessed in the same way as an array using bracket notation(example below), but can also be accessed by first typing in which object it is and then using a dot-notation identifying the label.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-text">
        For Example
        </h2>

        <img id="java-example"  src="images/object-example.png" photo.jpe alt= " photo";>
        <h2 class= "subtitle">
        Functions
        </h2>
        <p class="main-text">
        A function basically tells the code what to do next. It's basically like an instruction for the code. Functions are used by first identifying what the function does and then calling it. This is why functions can be very helpful as identifying what it does is only necessary to do once, which allows you to call it (basically command it to start) throughout your code without going through the hassle of re-identifying the function.
